## Status

| Category | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ADR Stage** | ACCEPTED |
| **Implementation Status** | Not Implemented |

## Summary

The aim of this document is to define the genesis parameters that will be used in the cheqd network testnet.

> Cosmos v0.42.5 parameters are described.

## Context

Genesis consists of Tendermint consensus engine parameters and Cosmos app-specific parameters. 

### Consensus parameters
Tendermint requires [genesis parameters](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#genesis) to be defined for basic consensus conditions on any Cosmos network.

#### Proposed values

* **`block`**
  * `max_bytes` = `200000` \(~200KB\)
    * Cosmos Hub: `200000` \(~200KB\)
  * `max_gas` = `2000000` (~20 txs)
    * Cosmos Hub: `2000000` (~20 txs)
* **`evidence`**
  * `max_age_num_blocks` = `1576800`
    * Maximum age of evidence, in blocks. The basic formula for calculating this is: `MaxAgeDuration / {average block time}`.
  * `max_age_duration` = `7884000`
    * Maximum age of evidence, in time. It should correspond with an app's "unbonding period".
  * `max_bytes` = `1048576`
    * This sets the maximum size of total evidence in bytes that can be committed in a single block and should fall comfortably under `max_bytes` for a block.
* **`validator`**
  * `pub_key_types` = `[ "ed25519" ]`

### Application parameters

Cosmos application is divided [into a list of modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/modules/). Each module has parameters that help to adjust the module's behaviour. Here are proposed values for default modules:

* **`auth`**
  * `max_memo_characters` = `512`
    * Maximum number of characters in the memo field
  * `tx_sig_limit` = `7`
    * Max number of signatures
  * `tx_size_cost_per_byte` = `10`
    * Gas cost of transaction byte
  * `sig_verify_cost_ed25519` = `590`
    * Cost of `ed25519` signature verification
  * `sig_verify_cost_secp256k1` = `1000`
    * Cost of `secp256k1` signature verification
* **`bank`**
  * `send_enabled` = `[]`
    * Enables send for specific denominations
  * `default_send_enabled` = `true`
    * The default send enabled value allows send transfers for all coin denominations
* **`crisis`**
  * `constant_fee` = `{ "denom": "ncheq", "amount": "10000000000000" }` (10,000 `cheq`)
    * The fee is used to verify the [invariant(s)](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/building-modules/invariants.html) in the `crisis` module.
* **`distribution`**
  * `community_tax` = `0.02`
    * The percent of rewards that goes to the community fund pool
  * `base_proposer_reward` = `0.01`
    * Base reward that proposer gets
  * `bonus_proposer_reward` = `0.04`
    * Bonus reward that proposer gets. This depends on the number of pre-commits included to the block
  * `withdraw_addr_enabled` = `true`
    * Whether withdrawal address can be changed or not. By default, it's the delegator's address.
* **`evidence`**
  * No parameters
* **`genutil`**
  * Used to manage initial transactions such as genesis validators creation
* **`gov`**
  * `deposit_params`
    * min_deposit = `[{ "denom": "ncheq", "amount": "8000000000000" }]` (8,000 `cheq`)
      * The minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period.
    * `max_deposit_period` = `1210000s` (2 weeks)
      * The maximum period for Atom holders to deposit on a proposal. Initial value: 2 months.
  * `voting_params`
    * voting_period = `1210000s` (2 weeks)
  * `tally_params`
    * `quorum` = `0.334`
      * Minimum percentage of total stake needed to vote for a result to be considered valid. 
    * `threshold` = `0.5`
      * Minimum percentage of total stake needed to vote for a result to be considered valid.
    * `veto_threshold` = `0.334`
      * The minimum value of veto votes to total votes ratio for proposal to be vetoed. Default value: 1/3.
* **`mint`**
  * `mint_denom` = `ncheq`
  * `inflation_rate_change` = `0.02`
    * Maximum inflation rate change per year
    * In Cosmos Hub they use `1.0`
    * Formula: `inflationRateChangePerYear = (1 - BondedRatio/ GoalBonded) * MaxInflationRateChange`
  * `inflation_max` = `0.04`
    * Inflation aims to this value if `bonded_ratio` &lt; `bonded_goal`
    * Cosmos Hub: `0.20`
  * `inflation_min` = `0.01`
    * Inflation aims to this value if `bonded_ratio` &lt; `bonded_goal`
    * Cosmos Hub: `0.07`
  * `goal_bonded` = `0.60`
    * Cosmos Hub: `0.67`
  * `blocks_per_year` = `6311520` (~5s)
    * Cosmos Hub: `4360000`
* **`slashing`**
  * `signed_blocks_window` = `120960` \(1 week\)
    * Cosmos Hub: `10000` \(~20h\)
  * `min_signed_per_window`= `0.50`
    * This percentage of blocks must be signed within the window
  * `downtime_jail_duration` = `600s`
    * The minimal time validator have to stay in jail
  * `slash_fraction_double_sign` = `0.05`
    * Slash for double sign
  * `slash_fraction_downtime` = `0.01`
    * Slash for downtime
* **`staking`**
  * `unbonding_time` = `1814400s` (3 weeks)
    * A delegator must wait this time before tokens become unbonded
  * `max_validators` = `125`
    * The maximum number of validators in the network
  * `max_entries` = `7`
    * Max amount of unbound/redelegation operations in progress per account
  * `historical_entries` = `10000`
    * Amount of unbound/redelegate entries to store
  * `bond_denom` = `ncheq`
    * Denomination used in staking
* *\[ibc\]* **`ibc`**
  * ...
* *\[ibc\]* **`capability`**
  * ...
* *\[ibc\]* **`transfer`**
  * `send_enabled` = `false`
    * Enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers from this chain
  * `receive_enabled` = `false`
    * Enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers to this chain

## Decision

The parameters above were agreed to be used for the cheqd network testnet, with a view towards testing them for cheqd mainnet.

## Consequences

### Backward Compatibility

* The token denomination has been changed to make the smallest denomination 10^-9 `cheq` instead of 1 `cheq`. This is a breaking change from the previous version of the cheqd testnet that will potentially require new tokens to be transferred and issued to testnet node operators.
  
### Positive

* Inflation allows fees to be collected from block rewards in addition to transaction fees.
* In production/mainnet, parameters can only be changed via a majority vote without veto defeat according to the cheqd network governance principles. This allows for more democratic governance frameworks to be created for a self-sovereign identity network.

### Negative
* Existing node operators will need to re-establish staking with new staking denomination and staking parameters.

### Neutral

* Voting time, unbonding period, and deposit period have all been reduced to 2 weeks to balance the speed at which decisions can be reached vs giving enough time to validators to participate.
