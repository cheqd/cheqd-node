# ADR 002: cheqd DID method, identity entities, and transactions

## Status

| Category | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ADR Stage** | PROPOSED |
| **Implementation Status** | Not Implemented |

## Summary

This ADR summarises the identity entities, queries, and transaction types for
the cheqd network and defines the cheqd DID Method. These transactions enable
similar use cases as those currently supported by
[Hyperledger Indy](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node), a verifiable data
registry built for self-sovereign identity (SSI) with a strong privacy focus.

## Context

Hyperledger Indy contains the following
[identity domain transactions](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/transactions.md):

1. `NYM`
2. `ATTRIB`
3. `SCHEMA`
4. `CRED_DEF`
5. `REVOC_REG_DEF`
6. `REVOC_REG_ENTRY`

Our aim is to bring the functionality enabled by these transactions into
`cheqd-node` to allow the use cases of existing SSI projects that work with
Hyperledger Indy to be supported by the cheqd network.

We define transaction that differ from the ones listed above, but
which enable equivalent support for privacy-respecting SSI use cases. The
differences stem primarily from our conformance to
[Decentralized Identifiers v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and the
capabilities of the underlying
[Cosmos blockchain framework](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) that we use.

## Decision - cheqd DID Method
The cheqd DID Method will conform to 
[Decentralized Identifiers v1.0](https://github.com/w3c/did-core) with the goal
of maximizing interoperability with other compatible tools and projects.

### Syntax
As with all DIDs, cheqd identifiers begin with the string `did:`.

#### DID Method Name
The `method-name` is the string `cheqd:`.

#### cheqd DID Method Specific Identifier

The cheqd DID `method-specific-id` is made up of two components, a `namespace`
and a `namespace-id`:

- **namespace**: A string that identifies the name of the primary cheqd ledger
(e.g., "mainnet"), followed by a `:`. The namespace string may optionally have a
secondary ledger name prefixed by a `:` following the primary name. If there is
no secondary ledger element, the DID resides on the primary ledger ("mainnet"),
else it resides on the secondary ledger. By convention, the primary is a
production ledger while the secondary ledgers are non-production ledgers (e.g.
testnet) associated with the primary ledger.
- **Namespace Identifier**: A self-certified identifier unique to the given
cheqd DID ledger namespace.

The components are assembled as follows:

`did:cheqd:<namespace>:<namespace identifier>`

Some examples of `did:cheqd` method identifiers are:

- A DID written to the cheqd mainnet ledger: `did:cheqd:mainnet:7Tqg6BwSSWapxgUDm9KKgg`
- A DID written to the cheqd testnet ledger: `did:cheqd:testnet:6cgbu8ZPoWTnR5Rv5JcSMB`

### Operations

#### General structure of transaction requests

All identity requests will have the following format:

```jsonc
{
  "data": { "<request data for writing a transaction to the ledger>" },
  "signatures": {
      "verification method id": "signature"
      // Multiple verification methods and corresponding signatures can be added here
    },
  "requestId": "<unique request identifier>",
  "metadata": {
    "versionId": "<transaction_hash>"
  }
}
```

- **`data`**: Data requested to be written to the ledger, specific for each
request type.
- **`signatures`**: `data`and `metadata` should be signed by all `controller`
private keys. This field contains a dict there key's id from
`DIDDoc.authentication` is a key, and the signature is a value. The `signatures`
must contains signatures from all controllers. And every controller should sign
all fields excluding `signatures` using at least one key from
`DIDDoc.authentication`.
- **`requestId`**: String with unique identifier. Unix timestamp is recommended.
Needed for a reply protection.
- **`metadata`**: Dictionary with additional metadata fields. Empty for now.
This fields provides extensibility in the future, e.g., it can contain
`protocolVersion` or other relevant metadata associated with a request.
  - **`versionId`**: String with a previous entity version transaction hash.
  Acceptable only for DIDDoc updating. This field is needed for a replay
  protection.
  
#### `DID` transactions

[Decentralized Identifiers \(DIDs\) are a W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
for identifiers that enable verifiable, decentralized digital identity.

DIDDoc format conforms to
[DIDDoc spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#representations).
The request can be used for creation of new DIDDoc, setting, and rotation of
verification key.

}
```

##### Verification Method

1. **`id`** (string): A string with format `<DIDDoc-id>#<key-alias>`
2. **`controller`**: A list of fully qualified DID strings or one string. All
DIDs must exist.
3. **`type`** (string)

5. **`publicKeyMultibase`** (optional): A base58-encoded string that conforms to
a [MULTIBASE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase-03)
encoded public key.
**Note**: Verification Method cannot contain both `publicKeyJwk` and
`publicKeyMultibase` but must contain at least one of them.

For Example:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue#key-0",
  "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
  "controller": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",

    "x": "VCpo2LMLhn6iWku8MKvSLg2ZAoC-nlOyPVQaO3FxVeQ"
    // external (property name)
  }
}
```

##### Service

1. **`id`** (string): The value of the id property MUST be a URI conforming to
[RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986). A conforming producer MUST
NOT produce multiple service entries with the same ID. A conforming consumer
MUST produce an error if it detects multiple service entries with the same ID.
It has a follow formats: `<DIDDoc-id>#<service-alias>` or `#<service-alias>`.
2. **`type`** (string): The service type and its associated properties SHOULD be
registered in the DID Specification Registries
[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/)
3. **`serviceEndpoint`** (strings): A string that conforms to the rules of
[RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) for URIs, a map, or a set
composed of a one or more strings that conform to the rules of
[RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) for URIs and/or maps.

For Example:

```jsonc
{
  "id":"did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue#linked-domain",
  "type": "LinkedDomains",
  "serviceEndpoint": "https://bar.example.com"
}
```

##### Create `DID`

If there is no DID entry on the ledger with the specified DID (`DID.id`), it is
considered as a creation request for a new DID.

**Note**: The field `signatures`(from `WriteRequest`) must contain signatures
from all new controllers.

##### Update `DID`

If there is a DID entry on the ledger with the specified DID (`DID.id`), then
this considered a request for updating an existing DID.
For updating `versionId` from `WriteRequest.metadata` should be filled by a
transaction hash of the previous DIDDoc version.

**Note**: The field `signatures`(from `WriteRequest`) must contain signatures
from all old controllers and all new controllers.

##### Resolve DID

DIDDoc State format:

`"diddoc:<id>" -> {DIDDoc, DidDocumentMetadata, txHash, txTimestamp }`

`didDocumentMetadata` is created by the node after transaction ordering and
before adding it to a State.

DID Document Metadata:

1. **`created`** (string): Formatted as an XML Datetime normalized to UTC
00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:
2020-12-20T19:17:47Z.
2. **`updated`** (string): The value of the property MUST follow the same
formatting rules as the created property. The `updated` field is null if an
Update operation has never been performed on the DID document. If an updated
property exists, it can be the same value as the created property when the
difference between the two timestamps is less than one second.
3. **`deactivated`** (strings): If DID has been deactivated, DID document
metadata MUST include this property with the boolean value true. By default
`false`.
4. **`versionId`** (strings): Contains transaction hash of the current DIDDoc
version.

For Example:
```jsonc
{
  "created": "2020-12-20T19:17:47Z",
  "updated": "2020-12-20T19:19:47Z",
  "deactivated": false,
  "versionId": "N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKueN22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
}
```

#### `SCHEMA`

This transaction is used to create a Schema associated with credentials.

It is not possible to update an existing Schema, to ensure the original schema
used to issue any credentials in the past are always available.

If a Schema evolves, a new schema with a new version or name needs to be created.

- **`id`**: DID as base58-encoded string for 16 or 32 byte DID value with Cheqd
DID Method prefix `did:cheqd:<namespace>:<namespace identifier>:` and a resource
type at the end.
- **`type`**: String with a schema type. Now only `CL-Schema` is supported.
- **`attrNames`**: Array of attribute name strings (125 attributes maximum)
- **`name`**: Schema's name string
- **`version`**: Schema's version string
- **`controller`**: DIDs list of strings or only one string of a schema
controller(s). All DIDs must exist.

`SCHEMA` entity transaction format:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue/schema",
  "type": "CL-Schema",
  "controller": "did:cheqd:mainnet:IK22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKu",  // Schema Issuer DID
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "Degree",
  "attrNames": ["undergrad", "last_name", "first_name", "birth_date", "postgrad", "expiry_date"]
}
```

Don't store Schema DIDDoc in the State.

      "type": "CL-Schema",
      "serviceEndpoint": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue?resource=true"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: `SCHEMA` **cannot** be updated

**`SCHEMA` State format:**

- `"schema:<id>" -> {SchemaEntity, txHash, txTimestamp}`

`id` example: `did:cheqd:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue`

[Link to DidDocumentMetadata description](#did-document-metadata)

#### `CRED_DEF`

Adds a Credential Definition (in particular, public key), which is created by an
Issuer and published for a particular Credential Schema.

It is not possible to update Credential Definitions. If a Credential Definition
needs to be evolved (for example, a key needs to be rotated), then a new
Credential Definition needs to be created for a new Issuer DIDdoc.
Credential Definitions is added to the ledger in as verification method for
Issuer DIDDoc

- **`id`**: DID as base58-encoded string for 16 or 32 byte DID value with Cheqd
DID Method prefix `did:cheqd:<namespace>:<namespace identifier>:` and a resource
type at the end.
- **`value`** (dict): Dictionary with Credential Definition's data if
`signature_type` is `CL`:
  - **`primary`** (dict): Primary credential public key
  - **`revocation`** (dict, optional): Revocation credential public key
- **`schemaId`** (string): `id` of a Schema the credential definition is created
for.
- **`signatureType`** (string): Type of the credential definition (that is
credential signature). `CL-Sig-Cred_def` (Camenisch-Lysyanskaya) is the only
supported type now. Other signature types are being explored for future releases.
- **`tag`** (string, optional): A unique tag to have multiple public keys for
the same Schema and type issued by the same DID. A default tag `tag` will be
used if not specified.
- **`controller`**: DIDs list of strings or only one string of a credential
definition controller(s). All DIDs must exist.

`CRED_DEF` entity transaction format:

```jsonc
{
    "id": "<cred_def_url>",
    "type": "CL-CredDef",
    "controller": "did:cheqd:mainnet:123456789abcdefghi",
    "schemaId": "did:cheqd:mainnet:5ZTp9g4SP6t73rH2s8zgmtqdXyT/schema",
    "tag": "some_tag",
    "value": {
      "primary": "...",
      "revocation": "..."
    }
}
```

### Security Considerations

TODO: add security considerations

### Privacy Considerations

TODO: add privacy considerations

### Rationale and Alternatives

#### Changes from Indy 

##### Rename `NYM` transactions to `DID` transactions

[**NYM** is the term used by Hyperledger Indy](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#nym) for [Decentralized Identifiers \(DIDs\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
that are created on ledger. A DID is typically the identifier that is associated
with a specific organisation issuing/managing SSI credentials.

Our proposal is to change the term `NYM` in transactions to `DID`, which would
make understanding the context of a transaction easier to understand. This
change will bring transactions better in-line with World Wide Web Consortium
\(W3C\) terminology.

#### Remove `role` field from DID transaction

Hyperledger Indy is a public-permissioned distributed ledger. As `cheqd-node`
is based on a public-permissionless network based on the
[Cosmos blockchain framework](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the `role`
type is no longer necessary.

#### Dropping `ATTRIB` transactions

`ATTRIB` was originally used in Hyperledger Indy to add document content similar
to DID Documents (DIDDocs). The cheqd DID method replaces this by implementing
DIDDocs for most transaction types.


#### Schema options not used
##### Option 2

Schema URL: `did:cheqd:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue#<schema_entity_id>`

`SCHEMA` DID Document transaction format:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
  "schema":[
    {
      "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue#schema1",
      "type": "CL-Schema",
      "controller": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
      "value": {
                "version": "1.0",
                "name": "Degree",
                "attrNames": ["undergrad", "last_name", "first_name", "birth_date", "postgrad", "expiry_date"]
              },
    },
  ]
}
```

##### Option 3

Schema URL: `did:cheqd:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue`

`SCHEMA` DID Document transaction format:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
  "schema": {
              "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
              "type": "CL-Schema",
              "controller": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue",
              "value": {
                "version": "1.0",
                "name": "Degree",
                "attrNames": ["undergrad", "last_name", "first_name", "birth_date", "postgrad", "expiry_date"]
              },
            },
}
```

##### Option 4

                "id": "cheqd-schema",
                "type": "CL-Schema",
                "schemaRef": "did:cheqd:mainnet:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue?resource=true"
              }
          ]
}
```

`SCHEMA` State format:

- `"schema:<id>" -> {SchemaEntity, txHash, txTimestamp}`

`id` example: `did:cheqd:N22KY2Dyvmuu2PyyqSFKue`

      "revocation": "..."
    }
  }]

}
```

`CRED_DEF` state format:

Stored inside [DIDDoc](#diddoc-state-format)

## Consequences

### Backward Compatibility

- `cheqd-node` [release v0.1.17](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v0.1.17)
and earlier had a transaction type called `NYM` which would allow
writing/reading a unique identifier on ledger. However, this `NYM` state was not
fully defined as a DID method and did not contain DID Documents that resolved
when the DID identifier was read. This `NYM` transaction type is deprecated and
the data written to cheqd testnet with legacy states will not be retained.
