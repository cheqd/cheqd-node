# Installing a cheqd node using Debian package releases

## Context

This document provides guidance on how to install and configure a node for the cheqd testnet.

* Our [guide to Debian packages for `cheqd-node`](readme.md) provides an overview of what configuration actions are carried out by the installer.
* The [node setup guide provides pre-requisites](../readme.md) needed before the steps below should be attempted.
* Separate instructions apply if you're looking to [upgrade an existing cheqd node](deb-package-upgrade.md).

## Installation steps for `cheqd-node` .deb

1. **Download** [**the latest release of `cheqd-node` .deb**](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/latest) **package**

   ```bash
    wget https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/download/v0.2.3/cheqd-node_0.2.3_amd64.deb
   ```

2. **Install the package**

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i cheqd-node_0.2.3_amd64.deb
   ```

   As a part of installation `cheqd` user will be created. By default, `HOME` directory for the user is `/home/cheqd`, but it can be changed by setting `CHEQD_HOME_DIR` environment variable before running `dpkg` command, like:
   ```bash
   sudo CHEQD_HOME_DIR=/path/to/home/directory dpkg -i cheqd-node_0.2.4_amd64.deb
   ```
   P.S. ability to change default `$HOME` directory is supported only in version `0.2.4` and upper.

3. **Switch to the `cheqd` system user**

   Always switch to `cheqd` user before managing node. By default, the node stores configuration files in the home directory for the user that initialises the node. By switching to the special `cheqd` system user, you can ensure that the configuration files are stored in the [system app data directories](readme.md) configured by the Debian package.

   ```bash
   sudo su cheqd
   ```

4. **Initialise the node configuration files**

   ```bash
   cheqd-noded init <your-node-name>
   ```

5. **Download the genesis file for a persistent chain, such as the cheqd testnet**

   Download the `genesis.json` file [corresponding a persistent chain](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/tree/main/persistent_chains/testnet) and put it in the `$HOME/.cheqdnode/config` directory.

   For cheqd testnet:

   ```bash
   wget -O $HOME/.cheqdnode/config/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/main/persistent_chains/testnet/genesis.json
   ```

6. **Define the seed configuration for populating the list of peers known by a node**

   Update `seeds` with a comma separated list of seed node addresses specified in `seeds.txt` for [persistent chains](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/tree/main/persistent_chains/testnet).

   For cheqd testnet, executing the following commands will set this up correctly:

   ```bash
   $ SEEDS=$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/main/persistent_chains/testnet/seeds.txt)

   $ echo $SEEDS
   # Comma separated list should be printed
   
   $ cheqd-noded configure p2p seeds "$SEEDS"
   ```

7. **Set gas prices accepted by the node**

   Update `minimum-gas-prices` parameter if you want to use custom value. The default is `25ncheq`.

   ```bash
   cheqd-noded configure min-gas-prices "25ncheq"
   ```

8. **Make the RPC endpoint available externally** \(optional\)

   This step is necessary only if you want to allow incoming client application connections to your node. Otherwise, the node will be accessible only locally. Further details about the RPC endpoints is available in the [cheqd node setup guide](../readme.md).

   ```bash
   cheqd-noded configure rpc-laddr "tcp:\/\/0.0.0.0:26657"
   ```

9. **Enable and start the `cheqd-noded` system service**

   If you are prompted for a password for the `cheqd` user, type `exit` to logout and then attempt to execute this as a privileged user \(with `sudo` privileges or as root user, if necessary\).

   ```bash
   systemctl enable cheqd-noded
   ```

   ```bash
   systemctl start cheqd-noded
   ```

   Check that the `cheqd-noded` service is running. If successfully started, the status output should return `Active: active (running)`

   ```bash
   systemctl status cheqd-noded
   ```

## Post-installation checks

Once the `cheqd-noded` daemon is active and running, check that the node is connected to the cheqd testnet and catching up with the latest updates on the ledger.

### Checking node status via terminal

```bash
cheqd-noded status
```

In the output, look for the text `latest_block_height` and note the value. Execute the status command above a few times and make sure the value of `latest_block_height` has increased each time.

The node is fully caught up when the parameter `catching_up` returns the output `false`.

### Checking node status via the RPC endpoint

An alternative method to check a node's status is via the RPC interface, if it has been configured.

* Remotely via the RPC interface: `cheqd-noded status --node <rpc-address>`
* By opening the JSONRPC over HTTP status page through a web browser: `<node-address:rpc-port>/status`

## Next steps

At this stage, your node would be connected to the cheqd testnet as an observer node. Learn [how to configure your node as a validator node](../configure-new-validator.md) to participate in staking rewards, block creation, and governance.
