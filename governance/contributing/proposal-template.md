**Description**

_A longer &lt;500 description of the changes you want to make, making direct references to where you want to make changes from, using links._

I want to change the cheqd Proposal Template because it misses a section on X. This amendment would make the process of making Proposals smoother for the entire community. The cheqd Proposal Template I am referring to in this Proposal can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSvevtJV1DXjOu30Y-sjWZmzRZPpkSIhM2HZm24Fwwo/edit\#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSvevtJV1DXjOu30Y-sjWZmzRZPpkSIhM2HZm24Fwwo/edit#)

**Consequences**

_This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the community and project in the future._

**Positive**

A new Governance template including X would be beneficial for the community and would make X easier to see.

**Negative**

No notable negative consequences

**Neutral**

Changing the template loses consistency over time
