# Contributing

## How do I make changes on the Network?

Every User is encouraged to contribute to the cheqd Network. To make this easy, it is important to explain HOW a User can contribute, and what the best practices are for making changes. 

For this reason, it is important to distinguish when a change can be made entirely off-ledger, and when a change is needed to be voted on, and made on-ledger. To do this we must differentiate between **minor changes** which are able to take place **entirely off-ledger** and **major network changes** which need to be **formalised on-ledger.**

### **Minor Network changes**

These are changes that are insignificant, and do not affect the way the Network runs overall. Minor Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Textual edits to the Governance Framework or written general documentation;
* Sensible additions to general documentation to improve clarity;
* Minor code changes;
* Finding, reporting and suggesting fixes to bugs;
* Translating the cheqd documentation into various languages.

### Major Network changes 

These are changes that have a materially significant effect on the Network. Such changes SHOULD be made via a Proposal, following the steps in the decision tree diagram below. 

Major Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Materially significant Architecture Decisions \(**ADs**\), such as:
  * An additional feature to cheqd;
  * Removal of a feature of cheqd;
* Parameter changes for the Network;
* Community pool decisions;
* Materially significant changes to a cheqd Principle;
* Partnerships or connections to other infrastructure.

## Decision Tree

To help YOU understand how to make changes on the cheqd Network, the decision tree below visualises how changes should be carried out.

## cheqd's Principles

Whenever a **major network change** takes place on the Network, reference MUST be made to cheqd's Foundational Principles. The Principles should act as a checks and balance against **major network changes.**

This means, that **major network changes** should never oppose a Principle, unless it is acting to update or change a Principle. For more information on how the Principles should be interpreted, see the Section on Principles. 

## Community

You do not have to own any CHEQ to participate in our community discussion. You are free to learn about cheqd and participate in our community discussions across multiple platforms and forums.

We want learning about cheqd and participating in the community to be easy and accessible. For this reason, we have decided to make sure our [wiki](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/) and our [source code](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node) are natively interconnected. 

**What does this mean?**

If you are a technical person and want to make changes directly to our source code, on a text-based or code-based change, you can do this directly on our [Github](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node).

If you are non-technical and want to make edits in a more visual way, you can do this on our [GitBook](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/).

**Let's summarise this easily:**

1. [Github](https://github.com/cheqd): Here we will host:
   1. Our open sourced code;
   2. Documentation to help YOU onboard to the Network as a Node Operator;
   3. Our Wiki page, with all formal documentation YOU need to know about cheqd, including this Governance Framework;
   4. A forum for discussion relevant to specific topics, issues and proposals. This is a space for you to make suggestions and proposals on how you want to improve cheqd, as well as participate in discussion with the community.   You can edit our Github through branches and pull requests, explained further in our Minor Network Changes document.  
2. [GitBook](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/): Here we will host:
   1. Documentation to help YOU onboard to the Network as a Node Operator;
   2. Our Wiki page, with all formal documentation YOU need to know about cheqd, including this Governance Framework;  GitBook will be a more accessible and easy-to-read layout.  You can edit our GitBook through branching our main repository and making edit requests, explained further in our Minor Network Changes document.

If you want to stay updated with cheqd news, we recommend that you join us on:

1. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheqd_io): Follow us here to keep up to date with the latest cheqd news and to be the first to hear about special announcements;
2. [Telegram](https://t.me/cheqd): Join our community here to participate in general conversation about cheqd with our core community following and be the first to hear about special announcements.
3. [Discord:](https://discord.gg/SQA8NpVe2v) Discord is a fantastic way to discuss topics in a more structured way, across specific channels related to your interests. 

We also kindly ask you to familiarise yourself with our Code of Conduct which sets our clearly defined expectations and behaviour that we want to uphold in the community.  

* [cheqd Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rbw-0TMg8PZO85R0SuDKffXnwrDTzcPrSrURPI3el7c/edit)

This ensures that the cheqd community remains a safe and welcoming place, for any person regardless of who they are.
