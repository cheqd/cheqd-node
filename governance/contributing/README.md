# Contributing

**Thank you for considering contributing to cheqd!**

You can contribute to the documentation in the following ways:

* Improving general documentation;
* Improving the governance framework;
* Contributing code to cheqd by fixing bugs or implementing features;
* Finding and reporting bugs;
* Translating the cheqd documentation into various languages;
* Making on-chain Proposals as to how the Network Principles of Parameters should change;
* Participating on Community discussion! 

## On-chain vs off-chain

We want contributing to be as accessible as possible. 

## Revisions and amendments

You are able to make revisions and amendments to the wiki and source code without making a formal Proposal. 

cheqd is an Open Source project which means that anyone is free to propose a revision, addition or amendment. 

Changes can be made through two routes:

1. [GitBook](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/)
2. [Github](https://github.com/cheqd)

### GitBook

GitBook is where cheqd's Wiki lives and where YOU can make suggested changes to the written documentation. 

To make a change, you need to use the link below to become an Open Source Contributor on cheqd's GitBook:

{% embed url="https://app.gitbook.com/invite/cheqd?invite=-MiVxCDUlLSB22RuQ6dl" %}

You should follow these instructions to make a change to any cheqd  GitBook content.

1. Make your own branch

To create a new branch, select 'New' followed by 'New variant'.

Next you need to name your new branch.

You should use the prefix:

* ADR/
* gov/

followed by a unique title indicating your draft number such as

* ADR/{username}draft1
* gov/{username}draft1

On this branch you should make and save all desired changes to the content.

Once you have finished your changes, save the branch but **do not merge the branch to main**. 

Your edits will be reviewed by a cheqd admin or moderator and then merged, amended or rejected.

### Github

You may also use Github to make changes and amendments to both the source code and the written content in this documentation.

You should similarly make a branch of the cheqd Github main. 

You should then make a pull request with your proposed changes, edits, revisions and additions. 

**Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests.** Assume that the person reading the pull request title is not a programmer, but instead a cheqd Network user or lay-person, and **try to describe your change or fix from in plain English**. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the main branch will carry the title of the pull request, and commits from the main branch are fed into the changelog. The changelog is separated into [keepachangelog.com categories](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and while that spec does not prescribe how the entries ought to be named, for easier sorting, start your pull request titles using one of the verbs "Add", "Change", "Deprecate", "Remove", or "Fix" \(present tense\).

Example:

| Not ideal | Better |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fixed NoMethodError in RemovalWorker | Fix nil error when removing statuses caused by race condition |

It is not always possible to phrase every change in such a manner, but it is desired.

**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.

**Pull requests that do not pass automated checks may not be reviewed**. 

## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Translations

You can submit translations via Github or GitBook branches \(as above\). We would greatly appreciate this work!

## Community

You do not have to own any CHEQ to participate in our community discussion. You are free to learn about cheqd and participate in our community discussions across multiple platforms and forums.

We want learning about cheqd and participating in the community to be easy and accessible. For this reason, we have decided to make sure our [wiki](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/) and our [source code](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node) are natively interconnected. 

**What does this mean?**

If you are a technical person and want to make changes directly to our source code, on a text-based or code-based change, you can do this directly on our [Github](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node).

If you are non-technical and want to make edits in a more visual way, you can do this on our [GitBook](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/).

**Let's summarise this easily:**

1. [Github](https://github.com/cheqd): Here we will host:
   1. Our open sourced code;
   2. Documentation to help YOU onboard to the Network as a Node Operator;
   3. Our Wiki page, with all formal documentation YOU need to know about cheqd, including this Governance Framework;
   4. A forum for discussion relevant to specific topics, issues and proposals. This is a space for you to make suggestions and proposals on how you want to improve cheqd, as well as participate in discussion with the community.   You can edit our Github through branches and pull requests, explained further in our [Contributing ](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/v/gov%2Fdraft1/governance/contributing)document.  
2. [GitBook](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/): Here we will host:
   1. Documentation to help YOU onboard to the Network as a Node Operator;
   2. Our Wiki page, with all formal documentation YOU need to know about cheqd, including this Governance Framework;  GitBook will be a more accessible and easy-to-read layout.  You can edit our GitBook through branching our main repository and making edit requests, explained further in our [Contributing](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/v/gov%2Fdraft1/governance/contributing) document.
