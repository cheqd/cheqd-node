# Advanced concepts

This section takes a deeper dive into some of the more technical, legal and architectural details of cheqd and its governance structure. 

This section will explain the following:

1. **Building on Cosmos**  Why cheqd decided to build on the Cosmos SDK, and what that means for the development of the Network.  
2. **Trust over IP alignment**  How cheqd aligns itself with Trust over IP and intends to build a governance framework that can be implemented by any Layer 1 utility going forward. 
3. **Network Parameters**  What the technical network parameters for the Network are. 
4. **Legal Disclaimer**  What are the potential accountability and liability risks for using the Network. 

Through an understanding of these more advanced concepts, Users and Node Operators should have a full understanding of cheqd and their duties and responsibilities in its development.
