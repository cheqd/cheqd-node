# Trust over IP alignment

## Building on Trust over IP

Trust over IP is a Foundation that intends to create an interoperable ecosystem for decentralised identity companies. It does this by segmenting decentralised identity into different stack layers, for different identity components.

The idea is that any ToIP Layer 1 innovation should be able to interoperate with any Layer 2, 3 or 4 innovation. 

We love this idea, and want our Network to be agnostic to the technology built on top of it, championing Open Standards and the latest SSI innovations such as BBS+ Credentials and a movement towards a unified Credential Exchange Protocol. 

This is a snapshot of the ToIP stack, which many of the SSI community will be familiar with.

If this is new to you and you want to learn more about it, you can take a look at their [new, cool interactive model here](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/).

cheqd intends to become a ToIP compliant Layer 1, with the first compliant decentralised governance model. 

Unlike traditional ToIP layers, cheqd will not rely on a centralised Governance Authority to maintain and take responsibility for the Network, nor its governance. 

Rather, the Network assumes authority, responsibility and accountability for the Network, as Entropy increases. 

This means that human accountability will actually be diluted across the Network, tending to a state known as sufficient decentralisation.

This can be represented by the following amendment to the stack:

As an entire stack, this now looks like:

This better reflects the decentralised nature of cheqd and its Layer 1 Network. We believe that this model is also still compatible with the spirit and intention of the ToIP metamodel, given that it wants to support and facilitate decentralised identity in its multiple forms. 

## Bridging Economies and ToIP

On top of catering for decentralised governance, an “Economy” or “payment“ stack also needs adding to the existing “Governance“ and “Technology“ stacks. This new stack augments the existing stacks with:

* Layer 1: Tokens to provide the medium of exchange
* Layer 2: Payment protocols to provide the mechanism of exchange
* Layer 3: Payment orchestration plug-ins to implement commercial constructs, such as subscription, transactional or flat fee models for ecosystems

All to create:

* Layer 4: Economies

_Notes:_

* _Economies within the “Economy“ stack, are simply Ecosystems with commercial structures / relationships whether unilateral, bi-lateral or multi-lateral._
* _Whilst the ToIP stack has a Governance Authority authoring Governance Frameworks, within Economies, the Governance Authority may be a range of structures from a single entity, through consortia to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations._
