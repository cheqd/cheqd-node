  can be made.

# Getting started with Governance

## **Before you cheq in...**

Governance Frameworks are generally perceived as largely inaccessible documents, for various reasons:

1. People do not understand what governance is, or why it is important;
2. The documentation is generally convoluted and difficult to find;
3. They are too formal and written in abrasive, legal language;
4. They do not educate the reader about the concepts they are governing.

At cheqd, we want our Governance Framework to be something that is easy to read, understand and use in practice. We want this document to be clearly understood by a diverse and multidisciplinary audience and collective, spanning across the world. 

We are committed to writing our documentation in simple language, using easy examples to explain difficult concepts, and designing a Governance Framework which is open and easy to change.

This is the most important part of any governance framework...  
****

**We believe that core to our governance framework, above all, is first, common understanding and common acknowledgement of how a system is run, and secondly, clear, accessible and democratic ways to influence decisions and the direction of change. This can only be achieved through clear communication, transparency and inclusivity.**



## **Lets make this easy, accessible and inclusive**

Through this Governance Framework, WE want to help YOU as a Network User, Node Operator or cheqd Community Member understand and familiarise yourselves with the following:

1. What Governance \(and decentralised governance\) is;
2. What cheqd’s mission is, and how our Network functions;
3. How you can impact Network Governance, either in off-chain forums, or through on-chain Proposals;
4. How the cheqd Network rewards participants through transaction fees and rewards;
5. What Principles YOU SHOULD uphold while using the cheqd Network;
6. The potential liability and accountability during the early stages of the Network’s development, during a period we refer to as ‘Low Entropy’.

In return, we kindly ask that YOU, while using the cheqd Network:

1. Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people;
2. Act with openness and respect to Users of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
3. Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback;
4. Accept responsibility for your mistakes, and are open to apologizing to those affected by our mistakes;
5. Focus on what is best not just for YOU and your desired outcomes on the Network, but make decisions with the entire community in mind. 

We also ask that YOU follow the provisions of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/blob/main/contributing/code_of_conduct.md) to ensure the best experience for others in the community. 

If you have any questions regarding the way cheqd's Governance is structured, please reach out to one of our Community leaders in the [cheqd Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cheqd-community/shared_invite/zt-toqyo7b7-2g9qDRjx3otd6529dTqeIA), ask a question in our [Q&A forum](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/discussions/categories/q-a), or email [governace@cheqd.io](mailto:governace@cheqd.io)

Let’s make cheqd a success together, and payment rails for authentic data a global standard: improving trust and efficiency in every industry.

## **Where to start**

If you are not familiar with Governance, and especially decentralised governance, we suggest that you should begin with our introductory documents:

1. [Introduction to Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swd1WtdPkhkVcxF0-efl185506kBld2zIUKvpKp3M_E/edit#heading=h.g1hnv482cbkn)  ****This document explains how we define governance, and why it is crucial in the management of a decentralised Network. ****
2. [Introduction to cheqd](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_FV8bfeM3ITZIZyTObmvIt2dszqrvtVLP-2AWz8TGo/edit#)  This document explains what cheqd is trying to achieve, and what the intended goal of the Network is. 
3. [Introduction to Entropy](https://docs.cheqd.io/cheqd-node/v/gov%2Fdraft1/governance/readme/introduction-to-entropy)  This document introduces the concept of Entropy in decentralised governance. Entropy is pivotal to understanding how liability and accountability changes as the Network expands. 

### Still a bit confused?

We’ve got some super simple videos on our Youtube channel explaining SSI and the objectives of cheqd.

1. [What is Self-Sovereign Identity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9f36Sh4CFM)
2. [How decentralised identity is used in real life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX38IhG7OpA)
3. [Why SSI is a better way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObhY0SGsFY)
4. [How cheqd’s model works and why we chose Cosmos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxNUfJ75LI)

And we also have a glossary to help you understand all this technical mumbo jumbo!
