        to interact with other Agents or with the cheqd Network or other distributed
        ledgers. Agents are of two types: Edge Agents run at the edge of the network
        on a local device; Cloud Agents run remotely on a server or cloud hosting
        service. Agents require access to a Wallet in order to perform cryptographic
        operations on behalf of the Entity they represent.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">A non-reciprocal relationship rooted in the Identity of one party, where
        the other party is the public (a faceless &#x201C;other&#x201D; that can
        be instantiated without bound). For an Organization to issue publicly Verifiable
        Credentials, its Issuer DID must be on a public ledger such as cheqd. It
        is thus an Anywise DID&#x2014;a DID to which any other Entity may refer
        without coordination. The term &#x201C;public DID&#x201D; is sometimes
        used as a casual synonym for &#x201C;Anywise DID&#x201D;. However, &#x201C;public
        DID&#x201D; is deprecated because it is ambiguous, i.e., it may refer to
        a DID that is world-visible but usable only in pairwise mode, or to a DID
        that is not published in a central location but nonetheless used in many
        contexts, or to a DID that is both publicly visible and used in Anywise
        mode. Compare N-wise and Pairwise.</td>

        the Credential is called the Issuer. The Entity holding the issued Credential
        is called the Holder. The Entity to whom a Credential is presented is generally
        called the Relying Party, and specifically called the Verifier if the Credential
        is a Verifiable Credential. Once issued, a Credential is typically stored
        by an Agent. (In cheqd&apos;s infrastructure, Credentials are never stored
        on the Ledger.)
