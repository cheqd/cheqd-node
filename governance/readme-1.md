# Principles

## Primer on Principles-based Governance

The Principles listed in this Framework are designed to provide a functional reference point for cheqd community members and Network Users voting on the Network.

These Principles are specifically designed to govern ‘on-chain’ governance activities. 

These Principles should serve as the foundation and baseline for the Network to build upon as it iterates and becomes increasingly decentralised. 

Updates, amendments or revisions to this Principles list can be made through plain-text Proposals, or Source Code Proposals explained in the Section [How cheqd’s Network Governance works.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_N9Fs3j_YOQdVZ3g3OZjOP8zbn5ZUpIHYQFdLC3uMs/edit#)  


## Foundational Principles

This section is a set of Foundational Principles which are core to the Network. They set a baseline of Principles which all other Principles sit underneath in terms of hierarchy. 

The Foundational Principles SHOULD NOT need to change throughout the lifecycle of the Network. They are designed to be flexible enough to underpin the Network as it progresses.   
  


## 1. The Principle Principle

A Principles based Governance model is toothless unless there is a Principle explaining how to properly follow and interpret the Principles. 

Given the genesis structure of the Network, a lot of power to govern the Network is vested in the architecture, and decentralised consensus from the Users of the Network.

For this reason, the Principle Principle holds that Network Users should follow these Principles. 

This Principle SHOULD be upheld in the following way:

If there is a clear contradiction between a Principle listed in this Governance Framework and a Proposal made to the Network, that Proposal SHOULD be either:

1. Rejected, meaning that it will not reach voting stage, but the creator of the Proposal will be refunded its tokens;
2. Vetoed, meaning that it will not reach the voting stage and the deposited tokens for the Proposal are burnt.

Naturally, it will be at the discretion of the voter whether to reject or veto the Proposal. The User SHOULD use their reasonable judgement to make this decision, based on the degree of harm the hypothetical Proposal could do to the Network.

Throughout this Governance Framework, it will be made clear where the veto should be used, to maintain the security and safety of Network Users.   
  
  


## 2. Keeping in-cheq

With respect to the Principle Principle, it is also crucial to balance the right to freedom of expression with the other Principles set forth in this document.

We do not want Users to feel hesitant to make genuine, well-intentioned Proposals, for fear of having their Proposal vetoed. We want Users to feel that their voice can be heard without being shut down and penalised. And we want to instill a culture of inclusivity and open-discussion. 

This Principle introduces an exception to the Principle Principle. If there is a Proposal to amend, add or remove a Principle which is well-reasoned and well-intentioned, such Proposal SHOULD NOT be vetoed. 

Voters SHOULD make a judgement call, based on their own morals and perceptions whether such a Proposal is genuinely well-intentioned; or whether it is created to antagonise, discriminate or cause harm to a set of persons or Users. 

Of course, if there is a strong personal sense that a Proposal constitutes the latter, then a veto vote will be the best course of action. 

We cannot set or regulate these boundaries, and we will not be able to intervene here, but we want the Network to self-regulate this delicate grey area itself, minimising toxicity and maximising inclusion.

We want the Network to keep itself in-cheq.

What does this look like?

## 3. Entropy always increases

Entropy is a new concept in this context. 

In a nutshell, Entropy is the transition from a centralised Network, where very few people make decisions that change the course and direction of the Network, to a fully decentralised Network, where a large, diverse collective reach consensus on the course and direction of the Network.

At the genesis of the Network, there will be a set of default parameters and decisions made by a select few. Therefore, this state has very Low Entropy because there is purposefully curated form, structure and order.

As more node operators join the Network, as more decisions are made, and as the capability to make a decision on the Network is spread across more and more Users, Entropy increases. This is because the initial structure, form and order is gradually dissipated. 

This Principle therefore holds that decisions made on the Network should be taken with a view to increase Entropy and to make the system more decentralised.

## General Governance Principles

The cheqd Governance Framework embodies the following General Governance principles. These General Principles should be used as checks and balances against new Proposals on the Network.  


### 1. Interoperability

cheqd SHOULD enable digital identity data for an entity to be represented, exchanged, secured, protected, and verified in an interoperable way, across multiple decentralised identity Networks, using open, public, and royalty-free Standards, such as the Standards for Decentralised Identifiers \(DIDs\) and Verifiable Credentials \(VCs\) defined by the World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\).  


### 2. Accessibility

cheqd SHOULD enable applications to build on top of the Network, maximising usability and accessibility, in order to create additional value and utility for other members of the industry. 

cheqd can be defined as a Layer 1 component of the Trust over IP stack, and SHOULD act as a module for other Layers in the stack to plug-into.  


### 3. Transparency

Cheqd Network and Community SHALL enable Network Users to easily access and verify information necessary to understand the incentives, rules, policies, and algorithms under which Node Operators and other participants of the Network operate.  


### 4. Integrity

cheqd Network and Treasury SHOULD uphold the highest levels of integrity in the running of the Network, ensuring decisions and proposals are made in a public domain, without coercion, in the collective best interests of the cheqd Community.  


### 5. Control

Network Users SHOULD control their own identifiers and encryption keys, and be able to employ end-to-end encryption for all interactions.  


### 6. Security

cheqd Network code and updates SHALL provide appropriate, measurable security of the data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using significant technical and organizational measures.  


### 7. Data Protection

cheqd Network Users SHALL NOT enable personal data, as defined in the GDPR, to be written to the Network, in either a plain text proposal, or a software update.  
  
cheqd Network SHALL ensure any data uploaded to the Network is anonymous and uncorrelateable. 

A User’s right to be forgotten \(i.e. the right for their personally identifiable information to be erased or put beyond use\) SHALL be promptly honored wherever applicable.   


### 8. Notification

Network Users SHOULD notify the other Users of the Network as soon as practically possible if there is a security breach, data breach or else if a Regulator has made an inquiry into the Network’s operations.   


### 9. Decentralization

cheqd SHALL not require reliance on a centralized system to represent, control, or manage the Network’s governance. Instead, the decisions on the Network should be made by a diverse collective, in line with the Principle of Entropy, ensuring there is no single point of failure.  


### 10. Sustainability

cheqd SHOULD always strive to be environmentally sustainable, given the imminent threat of climate change and the important role that the private sector can play in mitigating this threat. 

For example, this COULD be achieved through a Carbon Tax on the Network. A Carbon Tax is a nominally small fee that is charged for the use of the Network, which can be put aside into a Community Pool, and donated for the betterment of the environment. 

### 11. Inclusion

cheqd Users SHALL not exclude or discriminate against any other User within its governance scope, on the basis of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, incapacity, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, country of origin, heritage, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

cheqd Users SHOULD always seek to use inclusive and neutral language to best reflect the interests of a diverse, multidisciplinary and multicultural Network.

### 12. Privacy

The cheqd Network SHALL not allow any use of the Network that results in technical or regulatory privacy infraction, such as surveillance, personal tracking, and abuse. 

cheqd SHALL not be used as a Layer 1 component for further innovation that compromises Privacy.
